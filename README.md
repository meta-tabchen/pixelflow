# PixelFlow v2.0 🎨⚡

> **Visual Logic Without Boundaries.**

**PixelFlow** is a professional-grade AI visual creation engine that reimagines image generation through a node-based workflow. Designed for concept artists, designers, and prompt engineers, it leverages the power of Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash** and **Gemini 3 Pro** models to turn complex ideas into structured, repeatable creative pipelines.

## ✨ Key Features

### ♾️ Infinite Canvas Architecture
Break free from linear chat interfaces. Build complex logic chains where data flows visually from one node to another.
- **Topological Execution:** Run entire node groups in sequence.
- **Reference Chaining:** Use the output of one generation as the reference input for the next (Image-to-Image).
- **Group & Organize:** Cluster nodes into logical groups to keep your workspace clean.

### 🎥 Camera Director
The industry-first **Camera Director** panel gives you cinematic control over your generations without needing to know technical photography terms.
- **Framing:** Extreme Wide Shot, Full Body, Close-Up, Macro.
- **Angles:** High Angle, Low Angle, Overhead, Dutch Tilt.
- **Motion:** Pan, Dolly Zoom, Handheld, FPV Drone.

### ⚡ Smart Productivity Tools
- **Slash Commands (`/`):** Instantly inject professional presets like "Cyberpunk", "Photorealism", or "Studio Lighting" directly into your prompt.
- **Magic Optimize (`Ctrl+1`):** Stuck on a prompt? Let the AI rewrite your simple concept into a highly detailed, artistic description.
- **Workflow Library:** Save your best node graphs as reusable templates. Share logic between projects.

### 💾 Robust Data Management
- **Auto-Save:** Your workspace is automatically saved to local storage.
- **History Gallery:** Every image generated is archived with full metadata (prompt, model, seed, camera settings).
- **Vision Analysis:** Drag an image into the canvas to have Gemini analyze and describe it for you.
